[The field of somatics has developed over the last century through a process of inquiry into how consciousness inhabits the living body. The process which individuals undertake in these therapeutic and pedagogical systems can be seen as development towards increased differentiation and unity between various aspects of bodymind.][0]

Unique products of brilliant eccentric humans and the research communities which have grown up around them, different systems of somatics arrive at diverse sets of methods, techniques and principles for integrating Mind, Body, and Life context. One common focus is body awareness. Body awareness is an inseparable aspect of action and interaction with the environment and world. Mindfulness to current experience and a quality of relating to one's experience with an orientation of **curiosity, experiential openness, and acceptance** facilitates the movement of energy and information. Closed systems deteriorate - be they bodies, relationships, or cultures - however, systems which are open to the flow of information and nourishment can move into more complex orders of engagement.
